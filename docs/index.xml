Of course it is possible to download data diretcly from the Internet. However, in some cases there are limitations when downloading data. For example, only last 5 years of data is available, maybe the frequency is not suited to the needs of the analysis or it is cumbersome to update data on a regular basis in the code.</description>

      <description>Along with Ford Prefect, Dent barely escapes the Earth&#39;s destruction as it is demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Arthur spends the next several years, still wearing his dressing gown, helplessly launched from crisis to crisis while trying to straighten out his lifestyle.
 He rather enjoys tea, but seems to have trouble obtaining it in the far reaches of the galaxy.
 In time, he learns how to fly and carves a niche for himself as a sandwich-maker.</description>

      <description>In this theme, it is possible to add sections like a Projects one for example. You can add plenty of articles about your projects and a presentation page that will be displayed before the list. All is modulable, if you don&#39;t want something.
A Hollywood-funded film version, produced and filmed in the UK, was released in April 2005, and radio adaptations of the third, fourth, and fifth novels were broadcast from 2004 to 2005.</description>
