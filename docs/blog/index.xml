In particular, my problem was to find all packages that might contain any items related to the assessment of SOM.
Librarian PackageAfter goggling for a while I found the library(librarian) package which contains a function browse_cran() to search package names and descriptions within CRAN.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}MotivationFor my next post on Self Organizing Maps I started researching different ways on how to determine the quality of a map. Firstly, I found this article entitled “Evaluating Self-Organizing Map Quality Measures as Convergence Criteria”, which contains a couple of different measures on approaching the problem. Alongside it, I found R code in this thesis, which was used in the aforementioned article.</description>
