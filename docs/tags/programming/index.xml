      <description>I added to the blog a new section called “Books” - available from the toolbar above. Currently, there are books/articles that are related to programming or to different tools that can be used in R. I read those books/articles and I recommend them. This section will be updated step by step. In the future most likely by books that are related to programming in Python/Julia.If you know about any other interesting books about programming in R, please let me know in comments.</description>
