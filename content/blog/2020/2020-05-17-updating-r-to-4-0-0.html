<h1>New R Version!</h1>
<p>On the April, 24th a new R version was released - version 4.0.0. The complete list of changes/bug fixes/etc. in the newest version is available <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/NEWS.pdf">here</a>. In my opinion, following changes are the most crucial ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new syntax is offered for specifying <code>_raw_</code> character constants similar to the one used in C++, where r <code>...</code> can be used to define a literal string. This makes it easier to write strings containing backslashes or both single and double quotes.</li>
<li>The language now uses a stringAsFactors = FALSE default, and thus by default no longer converts strings to factors in calls to <code>data.frame()</code> and <code>read.table()</code>. Many packages relied on the previous behavior and will need updating.</li>
<li>matrix() now converts character columns to factors and factors to integers.</li>
<li>Packages must be re-installed under the new version of R.</li>
</ul>
<p>Especially, the <code>stringAsFactors = FALSE</code> default option might crash some of the older R projects.</p>

<h1>Experience / Challenges</h1>
<p>In the past I’ve updated/reinstalled/uninstalled many R versions, so I thought that nothing is going to suprise me this time. I was wrong.</p>
<p>This time for installation of the newest R version I used the <code>updateR()</code> function from the <code>installr</code> package. I run it directly from R and not from RStudio. In the past I had some problems later with packages when I opted for installation from R Studio. It worked perfectly until I wanted to load a package and start working on a small project. Then I reminded myself that for this R version I have to re-install the packages.</p>
<div id="challenge-1-reinstalling-packages" class="section level2">
<h2>Challenge 1: Reinstalling packages</h2>
<p>As a lazy person, I wanted to simply use the RStudio built-in functionality of updating all R packages, by simply clicking on the <code>Tools</code> on the toolbar and then <code>Check for Packages Updates...</code>. I was so suprised when I got a message that almost all of my packages are up-to-date and on the list there wasn’t a package that I tried to load to the R environment. I googled a bit and the simplest solution was to run follwing bit of code to update all packages - inculding dependencies:</p>
<pre><code>update.packages(ask=FALSE, checkBuilt=TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>As I have plenty of installed packages, it took roughly 1 hour to get everything installed.</p>
</div>
<div id="challenge-2-installing-new-rtools-and-changing-.rprofile-file" class="section level2">
<h2>Challenge 2: Installing new Rtools and changing .Rprofile file</h2>
<p>During the installation of many packages I recieved following error:</p>
<pre><code>WARNING: Rtools is required to build R packages but no version of Rtools compatible with the currently running version of R was found. Note that the following incompatible version(s) of Rtools were found:

  - Rtools 3.4 (installed at C:\RBuildTools\3.4)
  - Rtools 3.4 (installed at C:\RBuildTools\3.4)
  - Rtools 3.5 (installed at C:\Rtools)</code></pre>
<p>I downloaded the newest version of Rtools 4.0 and I thought that it will mute this warning. Unfortunately it didn’t. Somehow R couldn’t find the path to the new Rtools. By calling following function the new Rtools couldn’t be found:</p>
<pre><code>Sys.getenv(&quot;PATH&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Therefore, I had to add manually <code>PATH</code> to the Rtools to the system environment. I used the <code>edit_r_profile</code> function from the <code>usethis</code> package to edit the Rprofile.</p>
<pre><code>library(usethis)
edit_r_profile()</code></pre>
<p>By adding there a path to the new Rtools programme.</p>
<pre><code>Sys.setenv(PATH = paste(Sys.getenv(&quot;PATH&quot;), 
                       &quot;C:\\RTools40\\usr\\bin&quot;,
                       sep = &quot;;&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>Luckily, such changed finally solved the problem with the newest version of Rtools.</p>
<p>Good luck with upgrading your R to 4.0.0 version and happy R coding!</p>
