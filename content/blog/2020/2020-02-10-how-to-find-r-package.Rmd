# Motivation

When writing a new blog post on the assessment of the quality of fitted Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to the data I stumbled upon a problem on how to find all R packages that are related to a particular subject on CRAN. In particular, my problem was to find all packages that might contain any items related to the assessment of SOM.

# Librarian Package

After goggling for a while I found the `library(librarian)`{.r} package which contains a function `browse_cran()`{.r} to search package names and descriptions within CRAN. For example, if you can't remember what the `colorbrewer` package is actually called, you just type `browse_cran("colorbrewer")`{.r} and get the answer.

I decided to test it and to find any packages that are related to the topic of Self-Organizing Maps.
I found out that I cannot use the argument `som` to find any items, as all words containing `some` are also returned - which is a huge list. A quote `organizing map` should work, as in theory no other function should use those words.

```{r librarian_browse_cran}
som_data <- browse_cran("organizing map")
```

Indeed, the function returns a couple of packages that might have some functions to work with Self-Organizing Maps!

# How does the function work?

Okay, this function works, but the question is how. Let's check the contents of the function.

```{r browse_cran_function_contents}
browse_cran
```

Actually, there is a function `CRAN_package_db()`{.r} from the `library(tools)`{.r} which obtains information about current packages in the CRAN package repository, and their check status. Let's dig further.

```{r}
tools::CRAN_package_db
```

From the above script, it seems that all package info is stored on CRAN in one repository. Let's check this hypothesis, if any time stamp is available in the function ``{.r}.

```{r}
db <-  tools::CRAN_package_db()
colnames(db)
```

Actually there are `64` different variables in this data object from CRAN. It's a really extensive data set. Therefore, the question is if it is up-to-date or if it is outdated. Maybe it is archived only once a month?
The last 20 available dates are following:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
date_db <- db$Date %>% as.Date()
date_db %>% 
  sort(na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  tail(20)
```

There are some outliers but as the latest sensible dates are from the same day when this analysis is created then it is safe to assume that `packages.rds`{.r} file is up-to-date. Hence, this approach can be used to find out more about R Packages in CRAN directly from RStudio!
